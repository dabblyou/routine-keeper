# Routine Keeper

Final project for the Building AI course


## Summary

The app Routine Keeper tracks what its users do and where they do it in their house/apartment, so it can later tell them what they did and where, even if they can't remember it themselves.


## Background

Before you leave the house or apartment, you naturally close the window, turn off the stove, or the iron. But can you remember it afterwards?

Because such actions happen often automatically, as routines, they tend to don't make it into our conscious awareness, and it happens that we don't remember them. If you search the internet for this issue, you'll find that some people develop a new routine to make other routines more conscious: "Alles null, null – da kann ich gehen, ohne nochmal nachzusehen" (a German rhyme, roughly speaking: "All zero, zero – I'm free to go. No need to look back, I already know.").

In severe cases, this uncertainty can even turn into a obsessive-compulsive disorder that makes it difficult to cope with everyday life: those affected check things umpteen times, yet still feel unsure and return to check again.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
